-Java manages the memory through a program called garbage collector.
-Removes the objects that are no longer used.
-Garbage collection is done by daemon thread called garbage collector.
-We cannot force gc to happen. System.gc()
-If heap space is full, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError is thrown

-Whenever you run a java program three threads are created.
    a) Main thread-user thread
    b) Thread scheduler-daemon thread(runs in the background)
    c) Garbage collector thread-daemon thread

-We can call System.gc() or RunTime.getRunTime().gc() to explicitly call garbage collector. It is just a request to garbage collector and not a command. Thus, it is upto the garbage collector to honour this request.
